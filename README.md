# Slider
The content of the HTML document changes dynamically using an array of slides. This array can have as many slides as possible and the script will still work dynamically without having to adjust any of the values. Each slide appears in an animated way, so that the previous slide disappears smoothly. Once the array gets to the last slide, it goes back to the beginning, the first image of the array and starts over.
## Usage
Create a div element at your HTML document with id 'slider-container'
> \<div id="slider-container"></div\>
>
Insert the required stylesheet at the head of your HTML document
> \<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css"\>
>
Insert the script at your HTML document before the \</body\>
> \<script src='slider.js'></script\>
